# Avocado Price Prediction and Time-series Analysis
## I. Outline
- This project aims to make avocado price prediction and time-series analysis to predict growth of avocado in future.
- Analyze if we can expand our business to some regions of the US.
## II. Business Objective/ Problem
- Avocado “Hass”, a company based in Mexico, specializes in the production of a variety of avocados sold in the US. They have been very successful in recent years and want to expand. 
- They want to build a model to predict the average price of “Hass” avocados in the US in order to consider the expansion of existing avocado farms for avocado growing in other regions.
